      <h1>Preparations</h1>
      <p>
        To begin with the website, I made a wireframe on how I wanted my website
        to look like. Even when I already had some experience, I do have to do
        some research for the codings. Therefore I also had to prepare a lot for
        this to make sure I added all the stuff I need for the website. After
        Preparation for the wireframe, I then move to the coding. Before I start
        this part, I had to make sure that I use the right semantic tags that I
        wanted to use in my code, which most of them I always start by using
        header, main, and footer for the page. And after that, I just wrote down
        what I want to add in the coding to make sure I got everything.
      </p>

      <div class="desc">
        <h1>Project structure</h1>
        <p>
          For the Structure, first of all, I structured my files and folders in
          a way it would make it easier for me to find the files or folders I
          want to add or fix. All the page has their files and all the images
          have their folder. This will make it more organized and clean. To
          structure the website, I would add HTML, head, and body. These are the
          basic structure of the page.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="desc">
        <h1>HTML elements</h1>
        <p>
          For the HTML elements, I have already decided to use header, nav,
          main, and footer for the website by following the semantic tags
          template. This is very useful since it's an element of code that uses
          words to represent what the elements contain, in human language. I
          would then start adding header elements which I would add nav-bar in
          the heading so I can add what buttons or paragraphs I want. In the
          main element, I added section tags where I can put whatever I want for
          the main part which could be my info, etc. And the last element is the
          footer. Here I put the logo of my university I go with the contact us
          information like address and phone number. Besides that, it also
          includes the google map of the address. The credit of the person who
          designed the page.

      <div class="desc">
        <h1>Visual hierarchy</h1>
        <p>
          Visual hierarchy for the website I would want to give it a good visual
          design by using color or contrast to create the visual hierarchy on
          the page. I choose the light green color, since the goal that I
          promote, is green. Giving the website green color would make sense for
          the goal's color. As u can see from the header part, I added the
          gradient for the background so it's easier for the users to read the
          h1-text, just to make sure the original background color is not too
          bright. I then added all the text-box green, just to make it look
          better. I would not try to add a lot of colors. When too many colors
          of similar value are used, people's perception of hierarchy among
          elements is often reduced. The footer part would be a grey color since
          I want users to notice the footer when u scroll down. There u can see
          all the information with a map, address, and phone number. A great way
          for me to use typographic hierarchy in a way to improve my design is
          by using a typeface. From the header of the background, I drew myself
          the white line (similar to the goal3 icon) and added a gradient so the
          users can easily see the h1 text. By using visual hierarchy It would
          make it easier for users to understand information easily.
